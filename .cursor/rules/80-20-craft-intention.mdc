# The 80/20 Rule for Intentional Craft

Apply the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to software development to maximize impact and build with intention.

**Core Idea:** Focus 20% of your effort on the features, architecture, and user experience elements that deliver 80% of the value.

**Intentional Craft:**
-   **Identify the Critical 20%:** What parts of the application are most essential? Where will quality and robustness have the biggest impact? Invest your primary effort and highest level of craft here.
-   **Manage the Remaining 80%:** This doesn't mean neglecting the rest, but rather making *conscious decisions* about where to invest further effort.
    -   Is "good enough" sufficient for certain less critical areas?
    -   Where can polish provide disproportionate value?
    -   When is technical debt acceptable, and when should it be addressed?
-   **Goal:** Deliver the most value efficiently by prioritizing rigorously and applying craft *where it matters most*. Avoid over-engineering less critical parts and ensure the core is solid, well-designed, and delivers the intended experience.
