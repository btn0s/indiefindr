# Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)

## Beyond "Viable": Creating Products Users Love

In conjunction with our preference for a Minimum Excellent Product, we also embrace the concept of a **Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)**. An MLP goes a step beyond viability and even excellence in core execution; it aims to create an initial product version that users **genuinely enjoy and connect with emotionally**.

**Why MLP over MVP?**
*   **Emotional Connection:** An MLP focuses on evoking positive emotions (e.g., delight, satisfaction, engagement) in early adopters, fostering loyalty and advocacy.
*   **User-Centricity:** It places a strong emphasis on understanding and addressing the user's deeper needs and desires, not just their functional requirements.
*   **Differentiation:** In a crowded market, lovability can be a key differentiator. A product that users love is more likely to gain traction and word-of-mouth referrals.
*   **Iterating on Love:** It's often easier to scale and add features to a product users already love, than to try and make a merely functional product lovable later.

**Connection to Our Philosophy:**
The MLP guides us to invest our [Craft](mdc:.cursor/rules/craft.mdc) not just in functional excellence but also in the user experience elements that create delight and emotional resonance. This involves applying principles like the [Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)](mdc:.cursor/rules/pareto-principle.mdc) to identify where thoughtful design, intuitive interactions, and delightful details within the core experience can provide disproportionate value in making the product lovable. We prioritize crafting an experience that users will not just tolerate, but actively appreciate and advocate for.
