# Project Overview: IndieFindr

IndieFindr aims to be **the human-centric, AI-amplified discovery layer for indie games**. It addresses the difficulty players face finding compelling indie titles and the visibility challenges for developers. See [PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md](mdc:docs/051225-initial/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md) for full details.

## MVP (v0) Goal

The **Minimum Lovable Product (v0)** is hyper-focused on validating the core **semantic game discovery loop for Steam games only**.

**v0 Core Loop:**
1.  **Discover:** Personalized feed (`/`) recommends new Steam games based on **semantic similarity** (vector embeddings). Basic keyword search is also available.
2.  **Curate:** Users add interesting games to a simple personal library (wishlist functionality).
3.  **Play:** Users access the game's Steam store page link from the detail page or library.
