# Product Roadmap (User-Facing) — Impact ÷ Effort

Created: 2026-01-05 16:10:04

## Goal

Increase **session depth** (more “next clicks” per visit) by improving the core loop:

**search → game → recommendations → next game**

## Impact ÷ Effort ranking (user-facing only)

| Rank | Feature | Impact | Effort | Why it’s high ROI |
|---:|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| 1 | **“Load more / reroll” on Similar Games** (append, don’t replace) | High | Med | Strengthens the core loop: search → game → recs → click again |
| 2 | **Search: show Steam results even when DB matches exist** (section/toggle) | High | Low–Med | Prevents “dead ends” when DB has 1 mediocre match; improves discovery breadth |
| 3 | **Dedicated Search Results Page** (shareable URL + filters) | High | Med–High | Converts intent better than a dropdown; enables browsing + refinement |
| 4 | **Richer Game Detail** (genres/platforms/price/Metacritic) | Med | Low–Med | Makes pages feel “complete” and improves decision-making |
| 5 | **Collections Hub** (browse/search all published collections) | Med | Med | Turns collections into a first-class discovery surface |
| 6 | **Share / Copy link** (game + collection pages) | Med | Low | Easy growth loop; improves “send this to a friend” |
| 7 | **Screenshots carousel + long description** | Med | Med | Increases engagement time; helps users evaluate quickly |
| 8 | **Explanation UX polish** (expand/collapse, “why this one”) | Low–Med | Low | Improves clarity but doesn’t unlock new behavior |
| 9 | **Favorites + history (saved library)** | High | High | Big retention win, but heavier UX + data work |
| 10 | **Personalized home feed / Steam import / community collections** | Very High | Very High | Biggest upside, but best after core loop + discovery surfaces |

## High-level plan report

### Phase 1 — Core loop acceleration (highest ROI)

- **#1 Load more / reroll Similar Games** (append + keep best)
- **#2 Search: show Steam results even when DB matches exist** (section/toggle)

**Outcome**: more high-intent “next clicks” per session with minimal new surface area.

### Phase 2 — Discovery surfaces

- **#3 Dedicated Search Results Page** (shareable URL + filters)
- **#5 Collections Hub** (browse/search all published collections)

**Outcome**: users can browse/refine intentionally (not only “one-box search”).

### Phase 3 — Conversion + richness

- **#4 Richer Game Detail** (genres/platforms/price/Metacritic)
- **#7 Screenshots carousel + long description**
- **#6 Share / Copy link** (game + collection pages)

**Outcome**: “complete-feeling” pages and easier sharing.

### Phase 4 — Retention + personalization

- **#9 Favorites + history**
- **#10 Personalization / Steam import / community collections**

**Outcome**: returning users and tailored discovery.

## Dependencies (product-level)

- **#3 Search Results Page** benefits from decisions made in **#2** (how DB vs Steam is presented).
- **#5 Collections Hub** pairs naturally with **#6 Share** (collections are inherently shareable).
- **#9 / #10** are best after discovery surfaces are strong (otherwise you save a weak experience).

## Success metrics (pick 1–2 primary)

- **Primary**: CTR from game page → suggested game; “next click” rate per session
- **Secondary**: searches per session; time-to-first-click from landing; shares per session
- **Guardrails**: bounce rate on game pages; % sessions that hit “no results” states

## Recommendation

Build **#1** first, then **#2**. After that, choose between **#3** (bigger discovery win) vs **#5 / #4** (breadth + polish).
